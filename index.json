Using unsupervised machine learning, we identified two subcortical regions that influence the development of metacognitive abilities and the formation of the energy landscape metacognitive representation in the prefrontal cortex.

Despite its significance, high-resolution neuronal modelling using the Hodgkin-Huxley equations is computationally intensive and complex, especially when adjusting for individual biological variations. This presents substantial challenges in large-scale simulations. In this context, neural differential equations emerge as a promising approach, leveraging advancements in machine learning to enhance differential solvers. This study explores the integration of neural networks with differential equations to model Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Specifically, we propose a novel methodology that employs neural networks to approximate ion channel gating variables and to solve the differential equations governing voltage changes across the cell membrane, offering a more efficient and adaptable solution for large-scale neuronal modelling.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Differential Equations for Hudgkin-Huxley Model","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1671914296,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671914296,"objectID":"fbd9145648e5e1d8b29bda4097eff8cc","permalink":"https://ahmedalmijbari.github.io/project/cpg/","publishdate":"2022-12-24T21:38:16+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/cpg/","section":"project","summary":" This project explores the application of Matsuoka et al.'s oscillatory network model for controlling bipod walking and snake-crawling robots in distinct and challenging scenarios.

This project developed a diagnostic model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a ResNet architecture, leveraging transfer learning pre-trained on ImageNet. The model was trained on a pre-classified dataset of 3,429 X-ray images, comprising COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy patients. Its performance was subsequently validated using 378 out-of-distribution X-ray images from different patients. The model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 92% in correctly classifying the images into three categories: COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy.
