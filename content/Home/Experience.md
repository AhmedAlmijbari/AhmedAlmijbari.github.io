       <div style='text-align: justify;'>

       - Implemented large-scale data-driven methods to analyze over 200 GB of fMRI data and 160 million time series neural signals for exploring brain dynamics and identifying patterns associated with neural disorders, thereby enhancing the potential for diagnosing and treating mental disorders. 

       - Developed an energy landscape model that uncovers the brain representation of metacognition in the prefrontal cortex.

       - Identified two subcortical regions that influence the emergence of metacognition ability in the brain using unsupervised machine learning. 
       
       - Introduced brain information processing pathway of the subcortical-cortical interaction that gives rise to metacognition using information theory and mediation analysis.
