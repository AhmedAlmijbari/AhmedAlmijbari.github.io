       Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology.
       <div style='text-align: justify;'>

       - Developed large-scale data-driven systems to identify neural biomarkers of brain disorders, analyzing over 200 GB of neuroimaging data and 160+ million brain-signal time series. Advanced AI-driven diagnostic tools and personalized treatment for mental and neurological disorders. 

       - built an energy landscape model that uncovers the brain representation of metacognition in the prefrontal cortex.

       - Identified two subcortical regions that influence the emergence of metacognition ability in the brain using unsupervised machine learning. 
       
       - Introduced brain information processing pathway of the subcortical-cortical interaction that gives rise to metacognition using information theory and mediation analysis.
