Servus! I'm Ahmed, a PhD researcher at the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence, TU Munich. I recently graduated with honours from the Elite MSc program in Neuroengineering at TU Munich, earning two scholarships and the research excellence certificate from the elite network of Bavaria. My passion lies in developing NeuroAI systems to replace and restore impaired brain functions through brain-machine interfaces. I aim to create methodologies and technologies that redefine neuro-engineering and significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals with neural deficits.
