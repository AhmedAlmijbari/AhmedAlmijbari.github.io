I am a master's student of the ENB Elite MSc program in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich. Currently, I am doing research as a research intern at the Dynamics of Brain Connectivity Lab of The Neuroimaging Center at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen. My research investigates the neural information processing mechanism and dynamics of the brain during the emergence of cognitive functions using computational and mathematical analysis of fMRI data.
