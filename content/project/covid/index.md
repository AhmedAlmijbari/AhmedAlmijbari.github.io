title: "Detection of COVID-19 Patterns in Chest X-ray Scans Using Machine Learning"
summary: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> The urgent need for scalable, rapid, and accessible yet accurate diagnostic methods is paramount in combating pandemics. COVID-19 patients often exhibit subtle patterns in chest X-ray images that can be challenging to discern with the human eye. Consequently, machine learning offers a promising solution for automating pattern recognition faster and more precisely. This project developed a diagnostic model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a ResNet architecture, leveraging transfer learning pre-trained on ImageNet. The model was trained on a pre-classified dataset of 3,429 X-ray images, comprising COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy patients. Its performance was subsequently validated using 378 out-of-distribution X-ray images from different patients. The model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 92% in correctly classifying the images into three categories: COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy. This high accuracy demonstrates the model's potential as a reliable tool for rapid and automated diagnosis in pandemic response efforts.</div>"
