title: "Threshold-based Information Transfer System with IMU, EMG and Vibrotactile motor"
summary: "In this project, we built a system to transmit data between rooms via local WLAN networks using an IMU for encoding and four vibrotactile motors for decoding. we proposed a new method combining a threshold-based encoding strategy using IMU and EMG capable of encoding the numbers 0-9 to maximize the information transfer rate (ITR) without heavy pre-training for participants. An EMG signal is used as error-correction source to improve the accuracy on the encoding side. In experimental trials maximal information transfer rates of above 100 bit per minute and more than 99% accuracy were achieved in trials optimizing for one of both performance measurements at a time.
