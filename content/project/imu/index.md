title: "Threshold-based Information Transfer System with IMU, EMG and Vibrotactile motor"
summary: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> In this project, we developed a novel data-transmission system between two distinct locations using local WLAN networks, leveraging an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for encoding transmitted information and four vibrotactile motors for decoding. We introduced a threshold-based encoding approach that utilizes the IMU and electromyography (EMG) to encode numerical values from 0 to 9, aiming to optimize the information transfer rate (ITR) while minimizing the need for extensive pre-training of participants. An EMG signal was incorporated as an error-correction mechanism to enhance encoding accuracy. Experimental trials demonstrated a maximum information transfer rate exceeding 100 bits per minute and achieved over 99% accuracy, with performance optimization focusing on one metric at a time.</div>"
