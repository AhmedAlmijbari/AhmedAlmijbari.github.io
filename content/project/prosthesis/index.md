title: "EMG-based Prosthetic Hand"
summary: "Aimed at improving the quality of life for amputees after the devastating war in my city, this project designed and built an EMG-based prosthetic hand that operates as a part of the human bodyâ€™s nervous system, to participate in healing the current tragedy in our society. Our design was implemented by acquiring EMG data using local-made electrode and converted it into mechanical motion according to the desired 6 different movements. This model manipulates the electrical pulses by extracting some features -using Statistical features and Wavelet techniques- classified using machine learning into 6 multi-classes depending on their functionalities. The model is operated by servo motors which are controlled by Arduino Uno."
