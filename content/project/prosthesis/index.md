title: "EMG-based Prosthetic Hand"
summary: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> In response to the urgent need to improve the quality of life for amputees following the devastating war in Benghazi, this project focused on designing and constructing an EMG-based prosthetic hand that integrates with the human body's nervous system. We aimed to contribute to societal healing by providing advanced bionic prosthetic solutions. The design involved acquiring EMG data from the arm surface using locally made electrodes and converting this data into mechanical motion to perform six distinct movements. This model processes the electrical signals by extracting features through statistical analysis and wavelet techniques, which are classified into six multi-classes using machine learning algorithms. The prosthetic hand is powered by servo motors controlled via an Arduino Uno, ensuring precise and responsive movements. This innovative approach promises to enhance the functionality and usability of bionic prosthetic hands, significantly improving amputees' daily lives.</div>"
