title: "Real-time Sharp Wave Detection and Stimulation"
summary: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) are recognized as critical biomarkers for essential brain functions, including memory consolidation and episodic memory recall. Understanding the causal link between SWR mechanisms and behaviour necessitates the ability to perturb and modulate SWR events through precise electrical stimulation. This project focuses on developing a real-time neural implant SWR detection and stimulation system for closed-loop perturbation experiments, such as future optogenetics research. The system achieves a latency of less than 20 milliseconds, faster than the duration of SWR generation and dissipation, allowing for timely detection and disturbance of SWRs. With an accuracy rate of approximately 97%, this model is reliable for integration into closed-loop systems, providing a robust tool for investigating the role of SWRs in brain function.</div>"
