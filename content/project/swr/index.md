title: "Real-time Sharp Wave Detection and Stimulation"
summary: "Hippocampal sharp wave ripples have been identified as key biomarkers of important brain functions such as memory consolidation and recall of episodic memory. In order to understand the causal relationship between the mechanism of the sharp waves and behaviour. The SWR events can be disturbed by electrical stimulation. This is rely on accurate real-time SWR detection system. This project is aimed at building a real-time system for detecting sharp wave ripples that can be used in a closed-loop perturbation experiments, i.e future optogenetics researches. The designed model can achieve less than 20ms latency, which less than the speed duration of generating and vanishing of the sharp-wave ripples signal, so it can detect it and disturb it before it disappears. With around 97% accuracy makes it a reliable model to be implemented in the closed-loop system."
