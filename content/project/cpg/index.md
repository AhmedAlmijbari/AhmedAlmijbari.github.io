title: "Using CPG for Motor Control"
summary: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> This project explores the application of Matsuoka et al.'s oscillatory network model for controlling bipod walking and snake-crawling robots in distinct and challenging scenarios. Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are biological neural circuits that produce rhythmic outputs, which can be harnessed for locomotion control in bio-inspired robots. This work investigates how biological principles can inspire more robust and natural movement behaviours in robotic systems by implementing a CPG model on a microcontroller using Arduino. The CPG model was integrated with the robots to optimize their performance across the two tasks, providing valuable insights into translating biological locomotion strategies into robotic applications.</div>"
