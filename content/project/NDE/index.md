title: "Neural Differential Equations for Hudgkin-Huxley Model"
summary: "<div style='text-align: justify;'> The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a fundamental framework for understanding neuronal dynamics, capturing the intricate gating mechanisms of ion channels in the cell membrane and elucidating the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Despite its significance, high-resolution neuronal modelling using the Hodgkin-Huxley equations is computationally intensive and complex, especially when adjusting for individual biological variations. This presents substantial challenges in large-scale simulations. In this context, neural differential equations emerge as a promising approach, leveraging advancements in machine learning to enhance differential solvers. This study explores the integration of neural networks with differential equations to model Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Specifically, we propose a novel methodology that employs neural networks to approximate ion channel gating variables and to solve the differential equations governing voltage changes across the cell membrane, offering a more efficient and adaptable solution for large-scale neuronal modelling.</div>"
